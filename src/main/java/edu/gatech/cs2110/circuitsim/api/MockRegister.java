/**
 * Represents a "ghost" register: a register component replaced with Pin
 * components for easier testing. Useful for testing the combinational
 * logic in a sequential circuit by getting/setting the Pins contained
 * in it.
 * <p>
 * Idea: Suppose we want to test a circuit that looks like this
 * <pre>
 *                ______
 *       .-------|D    Q|------.
 *       |       |      |      |
 *       |       |_/\___|      |
 *       |                     |
 *       '--[ combinational ]--'
 *          [    logic      ]
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * but we want to test that combinational logic â€” who cares about
 * the register? So rewire the circuit to look like this
 * instead, where d is an output pin, and q is an input pin:
 * <pre>
 *       .-------(d)  [q]------.
 *       |                     |
 *       |                     |
 *       |                     |
 *       '--[ combinational ]--'
 *          [    logic      ]
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This way, we can test that combinational logic on its own by
 * setting the value of q and then checking the value of d. In fact, a
 * {@code MockRegister} contains a new input/output pin for every
 * Register Port so you can test the student connected all register
 * ports correctly.
